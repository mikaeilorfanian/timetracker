# Get a Grip On Your Time!
`timetracker` is a simple application that lets you
* Track the time you spend doing different activities during the day
* Generate reports that show you how you've spent your time

## Why Track Time?
Before you can improve anything, you need to be aware of how things are right now. `timetracker` reports help you become aware of how you're spending your time. Try it for at least one day and you'll be amazed by the results.

## How to Use It?
At this time, `timetracker` is not ready to be used. But, read on to find out what we're planning for it to become.

## Goals and Roadmap
### Goals
We want to design `timetracker` so that:
* you can easily track your time
* you can easily see how you've spent your time
* you can use `timetracker` on multiple devices

### Roadmap
TODO!
